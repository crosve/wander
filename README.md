# Wander

Our project is a cool travel app that helps people discover and share travel experiences in a new way. Using technology from Pinata and IPFS, it lets users create and explore custom travel guides, hidden spots, and local tips without relying on big servers. This means that the travel content stays online forever, canâ€™t be taken down, and is available to everyone around the world. The app is all about real, user-made travel stories.
